My computer installed the newest verwion of Firefox 94.01 64, Windows 7, OK, I like it much better. I had Private Bookmarks and eions.
verything worked very well until I added 94.  Any suggestions and where is the file normally stored.  I know the password, so if I can find it I hope that works.
Thank you for any help
